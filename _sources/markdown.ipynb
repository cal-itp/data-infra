    "\n",
    "Whether you write your book's content in Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) or\n",
    "in regular markdown files (`.md`), you'll write in the same flavor of markdown\n",
    "called **MyST Markdown**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is MyST?\n",
    "\n",
    "MyST stands for \"Markedly Structured Text\". It\n",
    "is a slight variation on a flavor of markdown called \"CommonMark\" markdown,\n",
    "with small syntax extensions to allow you to write **roles** and **directives**\n",
    "in the Sphinx ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are roles and directives?\n",
    "\n",
    "Roles and directives are two of the most powerful tools in Jupyter Book. They\n",
    "are kind of like functions, but written in a markup language. They both\n",
    "serve a similar purpose, but **roles are written in one line**, whereas\n",
    "**directives span many lines**. They both accept different kinds of inputs,\n",
    "and what they do with those inputs depends on the specific role or directive\n",
    "that is being called.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a directive\n",
    "\n",
    "At its simplest, you can insert a directive into your book's content like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "```{mydirectivename}\n",
    "My directive content\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "This will only work if a directive with name `mydirectivename` already exists\n",
    "(which it doesn't). There are many pre-defined directives associated with\n",
    "Jupyter Book. For example, to insert a note box into your content, you can\n",
    "use the following directive:\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Here is a note\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Here is a note\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In your built book.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on writing directives, see the\n",

    "### Using a role\n",
    "\n",
    "Roles are very similar to directives, but they are less-complex and written\n",
    "entirely on one line. You can insert a role into your book's content with\n",
    "this pattern:\n",
    "\n",

    "the `doc` role can be used to refer to another page in your book. You can\n",
    "refer directly to another page by its relative path. For example, the\n",
    "role syntax `` {doc}`intro` `` will result in: {doc}`intro`.\n",
