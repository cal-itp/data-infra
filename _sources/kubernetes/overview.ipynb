    "\n",
    "Certain features of node pools are immutable (e.g., machine type); to change\n",
    "such parameters requires creating a new node pool with the desired new values,\n",
    "migrating workloads off of the old node pool, and then deleting the old node pool.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once the new nodepool is configured, it can be stood up by running `kubernetes/gke/nodepool-up.sh [nodepool-name]`,\n",
    "or by simply running `kubernetes/gke/nodepool-up.sh`, which will stand up all configured node pools which do not yet\n",

    "#### drain and delete an old node pool ####\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a new nodepool has been created to replace an active node pool, the old node pool must be\n",
    "removed from the `GKE_NODEPOOL_NAMES` array.\n",

    "System workloads are used to support running applications. This includes items\n",
