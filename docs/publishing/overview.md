# Where can I publish data?

Analysts have a variety of tools available to publish their final
deliverables. With iterative work, analysts can implement certain best
practices within these bounds to do as much as is programmatically practical.
The workflow will look different depending on these factors:

* Are visualizations static or interactive?
* Does the deliverable need to be updated on a specified frequency or a one-off analysis?
* Is the deliverable format PDF, HTML, interactive dashboard, or a slide deck?

Analysts can string together a combination of these solutions. These options are
listed in increasing order of complexity and therefore capability.
* [Static visualizations](publishing-static-files) can be inserted directly
  into slide decks (e.g. PNG) or emailed to stakeholders (e.g. HTML or PDF)
* HTML visualizations can be rendered in [GitHub Pages](publishing-github-pages)
  and embedded as a URL into slide deck
* More advanced HTML-based reports can be hosted in the [analytics portfolio](publishing-analytics-portfolio-site)
  which supports interactivity and notebook paramterization.
* Interactive dashboards should be hosted in [Metabase](publishing-metabase) to
  share with external stakeholders.
* Structured data may be published to [CKAN](publishing-ckan) to facilitate
  usage by analysts, researchers, or other stakeholders.
