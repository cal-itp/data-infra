# The Cal-ITP Analytics Portfolio

Depending on the complexity of your visualizations, you may want to produce
a full website composed of multiple notebooks and/or the same notebook run
across different sets of data (for example, one report per Caltrans district).
For these situations, the [Jupyter Book-based](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html)
[publishing framework](https://github.com/cal-itp/data-analyses/tree/main/portfolio)
present in the data-analyses repo is your friend.

You can find the Cal-ITP Analytics Portfolio at [analysis.calitp.org](https://analysis.calitp.org).
