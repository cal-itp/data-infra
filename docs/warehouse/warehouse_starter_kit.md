# Warehouse: Where to Begin

[There is a large selection of data available in the warehouse.](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=cal-itp-data-infra&ws=!1m0) Consider this a short guide to the most commonly used tables in our work.

- [Important Links](#links)
- [Trips](#trips)
- [Shapes](#shapes)
- [Daily](#daily)
- [Other](#other)

## Important Links

- [DBT Docs Cal-ITP](https://dbt-docs.calitp.org/#!/overview) contains information on all the tables in the warehouse.
- [Example notebook](https://github.com/cal-itp/data-analyses/blob/main/starter_kit/gtfs_utils_v2_examples.ipynb)
  uses functions in `shared_utils.gtfs_utils_v2` that query some of the tables below.

## Trips

On a given day:

- [fct_scheduled_trips](https://dbt-docs.calitp.org/#!/model/model.calitp_warehouse.fct_scheduled_trips)
  - Use `gtfs_utils_v2.get_trips()`.
  - Answer how many trips a provider is scheduled to run and how many trips a particular route may make?
- [fct_observed_trips](https://dbt-docs.calitp.org/#!/model/model.calitp_warehouse.fct_observed_trips)
  - Realtime observations of trips to get a full picture of what occurred.
  - Find a trip's start time, where it went, and which route it is associated with.

## Shapes

- [fct_daily_scheduled_shapes](https://dbt-docs.calitp.org/#!/model/model.calitp_warehouse.fct_daily_scheduled_shapes)
  - Use `gtfs_utils_v2.get_shapes()`.
  - Contains `point` geometry, so you can see the length and location of a route a provider can run on a given date.
  - Each shape has its own `shape_id` and `shape_array_key`.
  - An express version and the regular version of a route are considered two different shapes.

## Daily

For a given day:

- [fct_daily_scheduled_stops](https://dbt-docs.calitp.org/#!/model/model.calitp_warehouse.fct_daily_scheduled_stops)

  - Use `gtfs_utils_v2.get_stops()`.
  - Contains `point` geometry.
  - How many stops did a provider make? Where did they stop?
  - How many stops did a particular transit type (streetcar, rail, ferry...)?
  - Detailed information such as how passengers embark/disembark (ex: on a stop/at a station) onto a vehicle.

- [fct_daily_schedule_feeds](https://dbt-docs.calitp.org/#!/model/model.calitp_warehouse.fct_daily_schedule_feeds)

  - Use `gtfs_utils_v2.schedule_daily_feed_to_organization()` to find feed names, regional feed type, and gtfs dataset key.
  - Please note,the `name` column returned from the function above refers to a name of the feed, not to a provider.
  - Use `gtfs_utils_v2.schedule_daily_feed_to_organization()` to find regional feed type, gtfs dataset key, and feed type for an organization.

### Other

- [dim_annual_ntd_agency_information](https://dbt-docs.calitp.org/#!/model/model.calitp_warehouse.dim_annual_database_agency_information)

  - View some of the data produced by the [US Department of Transportation](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd) for the National Transit Database.
  - Information from 2018-2021 are available.
  - Includes information such as reporter type, organization type, website, and address.
  - Not every provider is required to report their data to the NTD, so this is not a comprehensive dataset.

- [fct_daily_organization_combined_guideline_checks](https://dbt-docs.calitp.org/#!/model/model.calitp_warehouse.fct_daily_organization_combined_guideline_checks)

  - Understand GTFS quality - how well a transit provider's GTFS data conforms to [California's Transit Data Guidelines](https://dot.ca.gov/cal-itp/california-transit-data-guidelines).
  - Each provider [has one row per guideline check](https://dbt-docs.calitp.org/#!/model/model.calitp_warehouse.int_gtfs_quality__guideline_checks_long). Each row details how well a provider's GTFS data conforms to a certain guideline (availability on website, accurate accessibility data, etc).
