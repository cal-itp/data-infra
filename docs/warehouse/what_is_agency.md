# What is an `agency`?
`Agency` is a term that is used often across the Cal-ITP project but depending on the context of its use, it can have varying meanings when conducting an analysis.

Inconsistent use of the term `agency` can be confusing, so this section of the documentation seeks to help analysts determine how to translate the use of the word `agency` in research requests depending on the area of focus that the research request falls into.

| <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Area of Focus</span> | How to Identify an `agency` |
| -------- | -------- |
| **GTFS Datasets** | For both GTFS Static and GTFS Real-Time data, when trying to analyze GTFS datasets it is easiest to think of `agency` as **"unique feed publisher"**, with the exception of feed `calitp_itp_id` == `200` as it is a regional reporter that publishes duplicates of other feeds that we also consume.<br/><br/>**To identify "unique feed publishers":**<ul><li>Exclude `calitp_itp_id`== `200`</li><li>Deduplicate feeds</li></ul> |
| **GTFS-Provider-Service Relationships** | In the warehouse, this is the relationship between `organizations` and the `services` they manage. An agency can be interpreted as both depending on the use case. <br/><br/>This is not an exhaustive list of all services managed by providers, only those that we are targeting to get into GTFS reporting.<br/><br/>Each record defines an organization and one of it's services. For the most part, each service is managed by a single organization with a small number of exceptions (e.g. *Solano Express*, which is jointly managed by Solano and Napa). In all cases, it is best to define how you are using `agency` within your analyses.<br/><br/>**Reference table**: Use this table to identify provider-service relationships<br/> `cal-itp-data-infra.mart_transit_database.dim_provider_gtfs_data`<ul><li>Column: `organization_name`</li><li>Column: `mobility_service`</li><br/>|
| **Non-GTFS Datasets** | Depending on the data you are using, defining an agency can change. In most cases, an `agency` refers to a public entity. For analyses that include non-public entities, `organization` can be used as a catch-all term to include local government agencies and other entities that may not fall under this definition of `agency`.<br/><br/>**Examples of `agency` definitions:**<br/><ul><li>[DLA Local Public Agency](https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/programs/local-assistance/documents/guide/dla-glossary052022.pdf): "A California City, county, tribal government or other local public agency. In many instances this term is used loosely to include nonprofit organizations." |

**Note**: Defining your unit of analysis within your analyses — whether it be `agency` or `organization` or another term — can help clarify how you are using the term.
