# Published Images and Packages

Within Cal-ITP, we publish several Python packages and Docker images that are then used to underpin other work. Changes to these packages and images are deployed via CI/CD processes that run automatically when new code is merged to the relevant Cal-ITP repository. CI/CD processes for Python packages run a test upload to PyPI upon opening or modifying a pull request. CI/CD processes for images build the relevant image upon opening or modifying a pull request, but do not push a new image tag to GHCR until changed are merged into `main`.

Some images and packages manage dependencies via traditional requirements.txt files, and some manage dependencies via [Poetry `pyproject.toml` files](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/). Please refer to Poetry documentation for successful management of pyproject dependencies.

READMEs describing the individual testing and publication process for each image and package are linked in the below table.
