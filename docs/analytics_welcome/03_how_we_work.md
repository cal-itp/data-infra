#### Using the data-analyses Repo
A place for sharing quick reports, and works in progress
* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cal-itp/[REPO_NAME].git`
* Make a new folder and code your analyses in it.
* Make new branches or push directly to the main branch.
    * Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) (PAT) to successfully push to `origin/main`
    * When pushing a commit to `origin`, use your PAT, instead of your password.
    * To cache your token, use the [GitHub CLI or Git Credential Manager Core](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git)

This repository is for quick sharing of works in progress and simple analyses.

For collaborative short-term tasks, create a new folder and work off a separate branch.

For longer-term projects, consider making a new repository!
