## Teams Communication Channels

When communicating with Caltrans coworkers, we use Teams. The message retention policy for Teams is not permanent. [Open up a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/cal-itp/data-analyses/issues) with the appropriate template for any posts you make on the **Data Analysis** and **Data Office Hours** channels that are worth keeping for posterity's sake and/or are lengthy and complex in nature.

## GitHub Analytics Repo

The `data-analyses` repo is our main data analysis repository, for sharing quick reports and works in progress. Get set up on GitHub and clone the data-analyses repository [using this link](saving-code-jupyter).

For collaborative short-term tasks, create a new folder and work off a separate branch.

For large and long-term projects, create a whole new repo.
