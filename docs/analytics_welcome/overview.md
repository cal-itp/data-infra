# Welcome!

Welcome to the Analysts chapter of our Cal-ITP Data Services documentation!

Here you will be introduced to the resources and best practices that make our analytics team work.

After reading the 'Welcome' section, you will be more familiar with:
* Background on the Cal-ITP project
* The members of our team
* The meetings, communication channels, and other forms of collaboration that we use

After you've read through this section, continue reading through the remaining sections of this chapter for further introduction to the various technical elements required to conduct an end-to-end analysis.
