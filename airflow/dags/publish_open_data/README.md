Type: [Now / Scheduled](https://docs.calitp.org/data-infra/airflow/dags-maintenance.html)

This DAG orchestrates the publishing of data from the Cal-ITP data warehouse to the California Open Data Portal. Failures in this job may require coordination with the central data portal team if there is an issue with CKAN itself.
