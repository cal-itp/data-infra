  # For a given service_date, find the latest feed describing whether that date
  # is in service or not. For example, for 2021-04-10, the latest active feed
  # might be from 2021-04-09 (or even earlier, if it has not been updated recently).
  # Key features:
  #   * There should be one entry per feed x service_date
  #   * service_date may extend far into the future (depending on service_date_end)
  #   * is_in_service for service_date(s) past today are not stable. They reflect
  #     what the most recent feed thinks will be in service in e.g. 2050-01-01.
