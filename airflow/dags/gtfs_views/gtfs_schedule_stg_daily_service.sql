# For a given service_date, find the latest feed describing whether that date
# is in service or not. For example, for 2021-04-10, the latest active feed
# might be from 2021-04-09 (or even earlier, if it has not been updated recently).
# Key features:
#   * There should be one entry per feed x service_date
#   * service_date may extend far into the future (depending on service_date_end).
#     In this case we only extend out to a year from current date.
#   * is_in_service for service_date(s) past today are not stable. They reflect
#     what the most recent feed thinks will be in service in e.g. 2050-01-01.
