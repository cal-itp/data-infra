# `download_gtfs_schedule_v2`

Type: [Now / Scheduled](https://docs.calitp.org/data-infra/airflow/dags-maintenance.html)

This DAG orchestrates raw data capture for GTFS schedule data. It reads GTFS data configuration files that are generated by the [`airtable_loader_2` DAG](../airtable_loader_v2/README.md) to determine the list of GTFS schedule URLs to scrape (this DAG will just find the latest such configuration file, so there is no formal dependency between the two DAGs on a daily run basis.)
