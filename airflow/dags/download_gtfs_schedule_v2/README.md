# `download_gtfs_schedule_v2`

Type: [Now / Scheduled](https://docs.calitp.org/data-infra/airflow/dags-maintenance.html)

This DAG orchestrates raw data capture for GTFS schedule data. It reads GTFS data configuration files that are generated by the [`airtable_loader_2` DAG](../airtable_loader_v2/README.md) to determine the list of GTFS schedule URLs to scrape (this DAG will just find the latest such configuration file, so there is no formal dependency between the two DAGs on a daily run basis.)

## Secrets
You may need to change authentication information in [Secret Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager); auth keys are loaded from Secret Manager at the start of DAG executions. You may create new versions of existing secrets, or add entirely new secrets. Secrets must be tagged with `gtfs_schedule: true` to be loaded and are referenced by `url_secret_key_name` or `header_secret_key_name` in Airtable's GTFS dataset records.
