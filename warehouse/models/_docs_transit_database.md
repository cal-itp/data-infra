Docs for the Transit Database models; usually these are copied directly from Airtable.

{% docs components_table %}

Each component represents a single piece in a
transit technology stack.  It is part of a single
`Component Group` (e.g. CAD/AVL) which are often
bundled together, which in turn is part of a
`Function Group` (e.g. Fare collection, scheduling,
etc) and is operated in physical space defined
in `Location` (e.g. Cloud, Vehicle, etc.)
