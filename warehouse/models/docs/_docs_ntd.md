Docs for NTD models;

{% docs ntd_id %}
A five-digit identifying number for each agency used in the current NTD system.
FTA assigns each reporter a unique five-digit NTD Identification Number.

The code will have a four-to-five digit prefix for any entity submitting the report on behalf of the reporter.
For example, State Departments of Transportation (usually indicated as #R##) submit on behalf of their subrecipients.
