{% docs gtfs_stop_areas__stop_id %}
Identifies a stop. If a station (i.e. a stop with stops.location_type=1) is defined in this field, it is assumed that all of its platforms (i.e. all stops with stops.location_type=0 that have this station defined as stops.parent_station) are part of the same area. This behavior can be overridden by assigning platforms to other areas.
