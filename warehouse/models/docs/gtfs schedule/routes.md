{% docs gtfs_routes__agency_id %}
Agency for the specified route. This field is required when the dataset provides data for routes from more than one agency in agency.txt, otherwise it is optional.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs gtfs_routes__route_short_name %}
Short name of a route. This will often be a short, abstract identifier like "32", "100X", or "Green" that riders use to identify a route, but which doesn't give any indication of what places the route serves. Either route_short_name or route_long_name must be specified, or potentially both if appropriate.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs gtfs_routes__route_long_name %}
Full name of a route. This name is generally more descriptive than the route_short_name and often includes the route's destination or stop. Either route_short_name or route_long_name must be specified, or potentially both if appropriate.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs gtfs_routes__route_desc %}
Description of a route that provides useful, quality information. Do not simply duplicate the name of the route.  Example: "A" trains operate between Inwood-207 St, Manhattan and Far Rockaway-Mott Avenue, Queens at all times. Also from about 6AM until about midnight, additional "A" trains operate between Inwood-207 St and Lefferts Boulevard (trains typically alternate between Lefferts Blvd and Far Rockaway).
