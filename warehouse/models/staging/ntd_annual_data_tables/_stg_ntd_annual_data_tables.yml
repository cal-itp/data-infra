      Provides transit agency-wide totals for service data for applicable agencies reporting to the National Transit Database.
      This view displays the data at a higher level (by agency), based on the "NTD Annual Data - Service (by Mode and Time Period)" dataset.
      In the years 2015-2021, you can find this data in the "Service" data table on NTD Program website, at https://transit.dot.gov/ntd/ntd-data.
      In versions of the data tables from before 2014, you can find data on service in the file called "Transit Operating Statistics: Service Supplied and Consumed."
