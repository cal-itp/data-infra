      The tables in this schema comprise the tabs found in the `complete_monthly_ridership_with_adjustments_and_estimates`
      historical NTD ridership XLSX file, found at https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/ntd-data.
      This data contains monthly-updated service information reported by urban Full Reporters.
      This data release includes data values which differ from the  Raw Database Time Series (no adjustments or estimates) as follows:
      - Adjustments to historical data (report year 2002 to 2011) for specific agencies which
        changed data collection methodology and required data adjustments as a result (see Read Me tab for details).
      - Estimates for recent months where no data is reported by an active NTD
        reporter (i.e., an estimate due to delinquent report submission). These estimates are based on mode-level ridership
        growth estimates developed by FTA. The strength of each estimate improves when the population of agencies reporting
        in the prior period is larger.
      This file will be updated periodically by FTA to include data for subsequent months, and to incorporate revisions
      to prior months in the calendar year made by the transit properties. In some cases, this may include revisions to data
      from previous report years.

          The Monthly module includes a limited set of key indicators reported by transit properties. Data is reported on a
          monthly basis, by mode and type of service, for a fiscal year.

          The four data items included are:

          1. Unlinked Passenger Trips
          2. Vehicle Revenue Miles
          3. Vehicle Revenue Hours
          4. Vehicles Operated in Maximum Service (Peak Vehicles)

          This dataset presents these values in their own column in a long format (each row of the file is an individual
          Agency/Mode/TOS/Date). The data source is shared with the static Excel file hosted on the FTA website
          here: https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-adjusted-data-release. This dataset differs
          from the static Excel file in its formatting as well as being updated weekly, to capture data as it is reported
          and validated for a given publication month.
        columns:
          - name: agency_mode_tos_date
            description: |
              Unique row identifier derived by concatenating agency, mode, TOS, UZA, status, reporter type and date columns.
          - name: voms

          - name: upt
            description: |
