          Starting timestamp from which this record is in effect (inclusive).
          Because this table has not actually been fully versioned,

          time that this table was extracted from the source data.

        description: |
          End timestamp until which this record is in effect (inclusive).
          Because this table has not actually been fully versioned,

          Flag indicating whether this is the most recent version of
