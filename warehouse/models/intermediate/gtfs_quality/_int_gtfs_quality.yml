      `int_gtfs_quality__daily_assessment_candidate_entities` got too complex, so this
      table materializes a naive join of the organization, service,
      GTFS service data, dataset, and NTD agency info records for a given date.
      Constructed solely to be consumed by `int_gtfs_quality__daily_assessment_candidate_entities`,
      which is a more polished version for consumption.
      Do not use for any other purpose.
  - name: int_gtfs_quality__daily_assessment_candidate_entities
    description: |
      A row here is a combination of an organization, service, service / GTFS dataset relationship,
      GTFS dataset, and schedule feed that existed as of the given date. This combined entity
      represents a candidate for GTFS guideline adherence assessment. The `assessed` column
      indicates whether the candidate was actually in scope for assessment on the given date, based on whether:
      * The organization had `reporting_category` = 'Core' or 'Other Public Transit'
      * The service was `currently_operating`
      * The service had `service_type` 'fixed-route'
      * The service/GTFS dataset relationship was `customer_facing` or had `category` = 'primary'
      (i.e., according to our data, was this dataset ingested by trip planners on this date
      to represent this service)

      Entities that fail any of the criteria will *not* be included as `assessed` for the given date.

          and `gtfs_service_data_assessed`.
      - name: reports_site_assessed
        description: |
          Similar to `guidelines_assessed` except:
          * For entities associated with MTC 511, use the regional subfeed instead of the combined regional feed;
            i.e., for organization/services where the MTC combined regional feed is the customer-facing feed and
            "assessed" for guideline purposes, this feed will mark the associated regional subfeed (rather than the combined feed)
            as assessed for reports site (reports.calitp.org) purposes.
          * Entity must include an organization with an ITP ID assigned
          * Entity must include at least one assessed schedule feed

      - name: had_rt_files
        description: |
          If True, this entity had RT files downloaded. If False, this is either not an RT entity
          (ex. this is a schedule feed) or this is an RT feed that had no successful downloads
          on the given date. This field is primarily intended to be used for assistance in
          joining with the RT feeds guideline checks index.
  - name: int_gtfs_quality__organization_dataset_map
    description: |
      A version of int_gtfs_quality__daily_assessment_candidate_entities collapsed
      down to just the organization/GTFS dataset level (basically, removes services.)
      Columns are identical to int_gtfs_quality__daily_assessment_candidate_entities,
      except that OR logic has been applied to the customer facing and assessed columns,
      so that if this organization/dataset relationship is customer facing or assessed
      for any service, the entire relationship is marked as customer facing or assessed
      in this table.
