    description: |
      `int_gtfs_quality__daily_assessment_candidate_entities` got too complex, so this
      table materializes a naive join of the organization, service,
      GTFS service data, dataset, and NTD agency info records for a given date.
      Constructed solely to be consumed by `int_gtfs_quality__daily_assessment_candidate_entities`,
      which is a more polished version for consumption.
      Do not use for any other purpose.
  - name: int_gtfs_quality__daily_assessment_candidate_entities
    description: |
      A row here is a combination of an organization, service, service / GTFS dataset relationship,
      GTFS dataset, and schedule feed that existed as of the given date. This combined entity
      represents a candidate for GTFS guideline adherence assessment. The `assessed` column
      indicates whether the candidate was actually in scope for assessment on the given date, based on whether:
      * The organization had `reporting_category` = 'Core' or 'Other Public Transit'
      * The service was `currently_operating`
      * The service had `service_type` 'fixed-route'
      * The service/GTFS dataset relationship was `customer_facing` or had `category` = 'primary'
      (i.e., according to our data, was this dataset ingested by trip planners on this date
      to represent this service)

      Entities that fail any of the criteria will *not* be included as `assessed` for the given date.

      - name: public_customer_facing_fixed_route
        description: |
          Boolean indicator for whether this combined entity met the criteria to be "assessed"
          against the GTFS guidelines on the given date. Applies "and" logic to `organization_assessed`, `service_assessed`,
          and `gtfs_service_data_assessed`.
      - name: public_customer_facing_or_regional_subfeed_fixed_route
        description: |
          Similar to `public_customer_facing_fixed_route` except:
          * For entities associated with MTC 511, use the regional subfeed instead of the combined regional feed;
            i.e., for organization/services where the MTC combined regional feed is the customer-facing feed and
            "assessed" for guideline purposes, this feed will mark the associated regional subfeed (rather than the combined feed)
            as assessed for reports site (reports.calitp.org) purposes.
          * Entity must include an organization with an ITP ID assigned
          * Entity must include at least one assessed schedule feed
      - name: organization_assessed
        description: |
          Boolean indicator for whether the given organization record met the criteria to be "assessed"
          on the given date, i.e., had `reporting_category` = 'Core' or 'Other Public Transit'.
      - name: service_assessed
        description: |
          Boolean indicator for whether the given organization record met the criteria to be "assessed"

      - name: gtfs_service_data_assessed
        description: |
          Boolean indicator for whether the given service/GTFS dataset (`gtfs_service_data`) record met
          the criteria to be "assessed" on the given date, i.e., was `customer_facing` or had `category` = 'primary'.

        description: |
          Foreign key to `dim_schedule_feeds`. Because `dim_schedule_feeds` is slowly-
          changing dimension, joins using this key are not subject to the historical
          limitations noted for the other foreign keys in this table.
      - name: backdated_regional_feed_type
        description: |
          For reports site assessment purposes this field allows us to make regional subfeed selections
          from before the raw regional_feed_type data was available in Airtable.
      - name: had_rt_files
        description: |
          If True, this entity had RT files downloaded. If False, this is either not an RT entity
          (ex. this is a schedule feed) or this is an RT feed that had no successful downloads
          on the given date. This field is primarily intended to be used for assistance in
          joining with the RT feeds guideline checks index.
      - name: gtfs_dataset_deprecated_date
        description: |
          Deprecation date for the given GTFS dataset record. If populated, indicates record
          is no longer active and is kept for historical purposes.
          Informs whether we want to use the record for guidelines checks.
  - name: int_gtfs_quality__organization_dataset_map
    description: |
      A version of int_gtfs_quality__daily_assessment_candidate_entities collapsed
      down to just the organization/GTFS dataset level (basically, removes services.)
      Columns are identical to int_gtfs_quality__daily_assessment_candidate_entities,
      except that OR logic has been applied to the customer facing and assessed columns,
      so that if this organization/dataset relationship is customer facing or assessed
      for any service, the entire relationship is marked as customer facing or assessed
      in this table.
