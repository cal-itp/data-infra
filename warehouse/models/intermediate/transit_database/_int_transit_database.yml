      Currently this is unversioned; any historical URLs point
      to the latest version of their gtfs_datasets record.

  - name: int_transit_database__service_datasets_pivoted
    description: |
      A pivoted (wide) table showing a grouping of a service and a set of up to
      four GTFS dataset records (one of each type: schedule, RT service alerts,
      RT vehicle positions, and RT trip updates) that are associated with that service.
      For a set of GTFS datasets to be listed together, they must meet two conditions:
      1. They are associated with the same service, with the same category (primary or not)
      2. The RT feeds use this schedule feed for validation
