    description: |
      Creates a 1:N relationship so any given extract/URL in the
      GTFS models can identify its source gtfs_datasets record.
      Because GTFS dataset history from Airtable starts later than GTFS schedule history (feeds downloaded by the pipeline) or
      data can be downloaded in the gap between when an Airtable record is deleted and that deletion
      is reflected in the pipeline download configurations,
      this mapping back- and forward-dates the appearance of a URL in a GTFS dataset record to allow a URL
      from the GTFS data to map to a dataset record even if that URL
      was being downloaded before that dataset record was created or after it was deleted.
      I.e., if URL www.calitp.org/gtfs.zip was downloaded on January 1, 2022, but the first GTFS
      dataset record with that URL is record with key `123` and `123` doesn't appear until July 1, 2022,
      the January 1 download from www.calitp.org/gtfs.zip will still be mapped to GTFS dataset record `123`,
      even though it was downloaded outside the record's validity window, to facilitate some assignment of the
      GTFS feed data to organizations, services, etc.
