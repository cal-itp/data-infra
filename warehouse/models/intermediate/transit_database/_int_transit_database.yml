      Currently this is unversioned; any historical URLs point
      to the latest version of their gtfs_datasets record.

  - name: int_transit_database__service_datasets_pivoted
    description: |
      A pivoted (wide) table showing a grouping of a service and a set of up to
      four GTFS dataset records (one of each type: schedule, RT service alerts,
      RT vehicle positions, and RT trip updates) that are associated with that service.
      For a set of GTFS datasets to be listed together, they must meet two conditions:
      1. They are associated with the same service, with the same category (primary or not)
      2. The RT feeds use this schedule feed for validation

      captures the historical state of various attributes. This historical
      data is meant to be used for quality assessment purposes.
