      Each row is an individual download attempt combined with the associated unzip and parse attempts for
      a given feed on a given date.

      Each row is a feed (URL + timestamp), with a summary of whether parsing was successful on the constituent files
      within that feed.
      "Success" means that the raw input file (usually a .txt file) was converted to JSONL format without an error.
      This does not guarantee validity according to the GTFS specification, just that the original input file was
      parseable on a pure file-format level (i.e., the file was not corrupt.)
    tests:
      - dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns:
          combination_of_columns:
            - base64_url
            - ts
    columns:
      - name: base64_url
      - name: ts
      - name: count_successes
        description: |
          Number of successful file conversions within this feed.
      - name: count_files
        description: |
          Number of total file conversions attempted for this feed.
      - name: pct_success
        description: |
          Successes as a percent of total files (`count_successes` / `count_files` * 100).
          If this is a value less than 100, indicates that file conversion failed for some files in this feed.
