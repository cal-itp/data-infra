  - name: int_ntd_rr20_service_alldata
    description: |
      Combines 2023 and 2022 data in preparation for doing NTD validation checks.
      The 2022 data was *not* from the API and so formatted differently
      We are *assuming* that data in 2024 and onwards will be the same format as 2023
      If you get errors in 2024, check which columns may differ and read errors carefully.
