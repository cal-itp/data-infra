    description: |
      1st intermediate cleaning step for service data. Combines 2023 and 2022 data in preparation for doing NTD validation checks.
      The 2022 data was *not* from the API and so formatted differently
      We are *assuming* that data in 2024 and onwards will be the same format as 2023
      If you get errors in 2024, check which columns may differ and read errors carefully.
      NOTE!!!! You must add in the 2024 data when it is available with another CTE. IF NOT THERE WILL BE NO 2024 DATA CHECKED.
  - name: int_ntd_rr20_service_2ratioslong
    description: |
      2nd intermediate cleaning step for service data. Calculates all needed NTD metrics that are ratios of two other values. E.g., cost per hour,
      miles_per_veh,fare_rev_per_trip,rev_speed,trips_per_hr.
      NOTE this only works because there is ONE row per org, year, mode.
      If this ever changes or gets duplicated upstream, then these calculations will be off.
  - name: int_ntd_rr20_service_3ratios_wide
    description: |
      3rd intermediate cleaning step for service data. Pivots data from the 2nd cleaning step (above) from longform to wide form.
      NOTE!!!! A column for 2024 has already been added, but in 2025 and beyond you must go in and add a column for the year of interest
      e.g., 2025, (and up to you to delete any columns you don't want, e.g. 2022)
