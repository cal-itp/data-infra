  - name: int_ntd_a10_facilitiesdata
    description: |
      For assessing A10-032: Check that sum of total facilities for each agency, across all modes, is a whole number.
      NOTE: This model uses a dynamic variable for "this_year" which is based on the timestamp that this run started.
  - name: int_ntd_a30_voms_vins_totals
    description: |
      Gets the number of VOMS in the RR-20 and the number of VINS in the A30
  - name: int_ntd_rr20_financial_fare_revenues
    description: |
      Setting up the RR-20 data for comparing fare revenues to previous year
      NOTE: This model uses dynamic variables for "this_year" and "last_year" which are based on the timestamp that this run started.

  - name: int_ntd_rr20_financial_specific_funds
    description: |
      Setting up the RR-20 data for comparing specific funding sources - the 5311 funds, and Other directly generated funds
      For NTD validation error ID #s RR20F-070, RR20F-065, RR20F-068, RR20F-066, RR20F-013
      NOTE: This model uses dynamic variables for "this_year" and "last_year" which are based on the timestamp that this run started.
  - name: int_ntd_rr20_financial_total_exp
    description: |
      Setting up the RR-20 data for comparing totals, for operating and capital expenses, reported in different areas of the RR-20
      For NTD validation error ID #s RR20F-001OA, RR20F-001C, RR20F-182
      NOTE: This model uses a dynamic variable for "this_year" which is based on the timestamp that this run started.
  - name: int_ntd_rr20_service_1alldata
    description: |
      1st intermediate cleaning step for service data. Combines the current year and previous year data in preparation for doing NTD validation checks.
      NOTE: This model uses dynamic variables for "this_year" and "last_year" which are based on the timestamp that this run started.
    config:
      materialized: table
  - name: int_ntd_rr20_service_2ratioslong
    description: |
      2nd intermediate cleaning step for service data. Calculates all needed NTD metrics that are ratios of two other values. E.g., cost per hour,
      miles_per_veh,fare_rev_per_trip,rev_speed,trips_per_hr.
      NOTE this only works because there is ONE row per org, year, mode.
      If this ever changes or gets duplicated upstream, then these calculations will be off.
  - name: int_ntd_rr20_service_3ratios_wide
    description: |
      3rd intermediate cleaning step for service data. Pivots data from the 2nd cleaning step (above) from longform to wide form.
      NOTE: This model uses dynamic variables for "this_year" and "last_year" which are based on the timestamp that this run started.
    config:
