  - name: int_payments__authorisations_deduped
    description: |
      This model deduplicates authorisations rows with duplicate `_payments_key` values that require additional handling
      beyond what is covered in the staging model, essentially rows that require a join for deduplication.
      Columns have the same meanings as in the upstream staging model.
      The most important test for this model is on the upstream staging model: to ensure that no
      `_payments_key` values are fully dropped betweeen that model and this one (i.e., to ensure
      that all rows dropped do in fact have a duplicate and no authorisations are lost.)
    columns:
      - name: request_type

  - name: int_payments__latest_authorisations_by_aggregation
    description: |
      This model contains only the most recent authorisations data per `aggregation_id`.
      Many aggregations pass through a few different authorisations (for example, perhaps a card check
      before getting authorised, or multiple debt recovery attempts.) This model keeps only the most
      recent row according to `authorisation_date_time_utc`.
    columns:
      - &aggregation_pk
        name: aggregation_id
        description: |
          ID of the aggregation being summarized. An aggregation can contain or be associated with multiple
          micropayment, authorisation, and settlement events. It represents the unit at which settlement occurs
          (so multiple settlement events only occur for a single aggregation if there are refunds against the original settlement.)

    description: |
      This model is a union of refunds found both in `stg_littlepay__refunds` and `stg_littlepay__micropayments`.
      It includes deduplication of refunds that appear multiple times with multiple statuses, to only take the most recent status,
      and also deduplicates based on `coalesced_id` which is `retrieval_reference_number` or `aggregation_id` if `retrieval_reference_number` is `NULL`.

      Columns have the same meanings as in the upstream staging model.

      The most important test for this model is on the upstream staging model: to ensure that no
      `retrieval_reference_number` or `aggregation_id` values are fully dropped betweeen that model and this one (i.e., to ensure
      that all rows dropped do in fact have a duplicate and no refunds are lost.)
    columns:

        description: The unique identifier for each requested refund.
      - name: aggregation_id
        description: |
          The aggregation that contains the refund.

      - name: micropayment_id
        description: |
          Uniquely identifies the micropayment being refunded.
          For some agencies, this mapping fails due to upstream data issues and `aggregation_id` must be used as a fallback.
      - *participant_id
      - name: customer_id
        description: Identifies the customer that the micropayment belongs to.
      - name: refund_amount
