  - name: int_payments__authorisations_deduped
    description: |
      This model deduplicates authorisations rows with duplicate `_payments_key` values that require additional handling
      beyond what is covered in the staging model, essentially rows that require a join for deduplication.
      Columns have the same meanings as in the upstream staging model.
      The most important test for this model is on the upstream staging model: to ensure that no
      `_payments_key` values are fully dropped betweeen that model and this one (i.e., to ensure
      that all rows dropped do in fact have a duplicate and no authorisations are lost.)

              field: aggregation_id
  - name: int_payments__authorisations_summarized
    description: |
      This model contains only the most recent authorisations data per `aggregation_id`.
      Many aggregations pass through a few different authorisations (for example, perhaps a card check
      before getting authorised, or multiple debt recovery attempts.) This model keeps only the most
      recent row according to `authorisation_date_time_utc`.
    columns:
      - name: aggregation_id

          - unique
  - name: int_payments__settlements_summarized
    description: |
      This model contains Littlepay settlements aggregated to the `aggregation_id + retrieval_reference_number` level.

    columns:

      - name: contains_imputed_type
        description: |
          Some settlements are missing `settlement_type` (i.e., `DEBIT` vs. `CREDIT` designation).
          We impute those missing values on the heuristic that first updates tend to be the debit
          and any subsequent updates are credits (refunds).
          Rows with "true" in this column indicate that at least one input row had its settlement type imputed.
          These rows could potentially (though we believe it is unlikely) be sources of error if the imputation
          assumptions were incorrect.
      - name: contains_refund
        description: |
          If `true`, this aggregation settlement included at least one row with settlement_type = `CREDIT`.
      - name: latest_update_timestamp
        description: |
          Most recent `settlement_requested_date_time_utc` value for this aggregation settlement.
          If a credit (refund) was issued after the initial debit, this will be the timestamp of the credit.
      - name: net_settled_amount_dollars
        description: |
          Net dollar amount of this aggregation settlement; if a refund (credit) has been issued,
          that will be reflected. So for example if $20 was debited and then $8 was credited,
          the value in this column will be `12` (= 20 - 8).
        tests:
          - dbt_utils.accepted_range:
              min_value: 0
              inclusive: true
      - name: debit_amount
        description: |
          Total dollar amount associated with debit settlements in this aggregation.
          Numbers in this column are positive because they represent amounts debited (charged) by the participant to the customer (rider);
          i.e., these values represent income for the participant (agency).
      - name: credit_amount
        description: |
          Total dollar amount associated with credit (refund) settlements in this aggregation.
          Numbers in this column are negative because they represent amounts credited (refunded) by the participant (agency) to the customer (rider);
          i.e., these values represent costs for the participant (agency).
