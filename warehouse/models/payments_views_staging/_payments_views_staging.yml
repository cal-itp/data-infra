        description: |
          Authorisations represent the communication with the acquirer that is
          not a settlement. As part of this process, Littlepay performs
          verification with the acquirer to check if a card is valid and has
          sufficient funds to complete the transaction, which is based on the
          cardholder scheme prerequisites.

          Each row of data in the authorisation table represents a communication
          with the acquirer that is represented by the `request_type`.

          is received via Device API (i.e., from the PAD vendors).

          The data within the device transaction table summarises key
          information about the tap, the device the user tapped, the location of
          the device, and the type of fare attributed to the transaction.

          > need to tap on at the start of their trip and tap off at the end of
