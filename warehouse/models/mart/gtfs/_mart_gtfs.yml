  - name: dim_schedule_feeds
    description: |
      Each row is a "feed", representing a unique zipfile version associated with the same GTFS dataset record
      that was successfully downloaded and has data in the warehouse.
      When data fails to download, we do not interpolate it unless an identical zipfile is subsequently
      downloaded. So for example, say we download zipfile A from URL X on January 1, then the download
      or unzip operation fails for any reason on January 2, and then we download zipfile A from URL X
      again on January 3. If you check this table on January 3 before the new data has appeared in the
      warehouse, it will show zipfile A has expired on January 2. But once the same zipfile is ingested
      again, if you check on January 4, we will show that zipfile A was continuously in effect
      January 1-3. The reason for this is that if a new zipfile version B were to be uploaded on January 3,
      we would want to correctly say that we don't know what was in effect on January 2.
      This table should be used to understand "versions" of constituent data like routes, trips, etc.

          Because GTFS data was downloaded in the v1 pipeline before
          `gtfs dataset` records were being archived in the warehouse,
          it is possible for GTFS data to be associated with a GTFS dataset
          record that was not yet in effect at the time the data was downloaded.
          (So, you may see GTFS data from January 2022 associated with a GTFS dataset
          record that does not take effect until July 2022.)
          This is done for convenience to facilitate labeling of older data (the alternative
          would be failing to join and making it essentially impossible to label
          historical GTFS data with any associated transit database records).

          This is a calculated field that does not come from GTFS - it is not a timestamp and can't be treated as such.

          Represents `arrival_time` as a total number of seconds after midnight of the first day of the given trip.
          For example, `arrival_time = 21:30:45` would lead to `arrival_sec = 21 * 3,600 + 30 * 60 + 45 * 1 = 77,445`.
          This allows us to perform duration calculations and handle timestamps that wrap past midnight like

          Because GTFS data was downloaded in the v1 pipeline before
          `gtfs dataset` records were being archived in the warehouse,
          it is possible for GTFS data to be associated with a GTFS dataset
          record that was not yet in effect at the time the data was downloaded.
          (So, you may see GTFS data from January 2022 associated with a GTFS dataset
          record that does not take effect until July 2022.)
          This is done for convenience to facilitate labeling of older data (the alternative
          would be failing to join and making it essentially impossible to label
          historical GTFS data with their associated transit database records).

        Foreign key to the associated GTFS dataset record.
        Because GTFS data was downloaded in the v1 pipeline before
        `gtfs dataset` records were being archived in the warehouse,
        it is possible for GTFS data to be associated with a GTFS dataset
        record that was not yet in effect at the time the data was downloaded.
        (So, you may see GTFS data from January 2022 associated with a GTFS dataset
        record that does not take effect until July 2022.)
        This is done for convenience to facilitate labeling of older data (the alternative
        would be failing to join and making it essentially impossible to label
        historical GTFS data with their associated transit database records).
