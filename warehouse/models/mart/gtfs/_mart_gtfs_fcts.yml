      Each row is a unique date / feed pair, where the feed is the feed version that was in effect at

          Because GTFS data was downloaded in the v1 pipeline before
          `gtfs dataset` records were being archived in the warehouse,
          it is possible for GTFS data to be associated with a GTFS dataset
          record that was not yet in effect at the time the data was downloaded.
          (So, you may see GTFS data from January 2022 associated with a GTFS dataset
          record that does not take effect until July 2022.)
          This is done for convenience to facilitate labeling of older data (the alternative
          would be failing to join and making it essentially impossible to label
          historical GTFS data with any associated transit database records).

  - name: fct_daily_scheduled_trips
    description: |
      A daily table showing all trips that were scheduled on a given date.
      If a `service_date`, `trip_key` pair is present in this table,
      it means that that `trip_key` was scheduled to occur on that `service_date`.
      Specifically, it means that the associated `service_id` was active and had service
      scheduled. Dates where a `service_id` was active but not scheduled (for example,
      weekend dates within a weekday service's effective dates) are not listed in this table.

      The GTFS standard allows for a trip's scheduled stop activity to occur more than 24 hours after the beginning of the
      associated `service_date`. See https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#field-types for the GTFS definitions of times and dates.

      Additionally, different feeds use different time zones (see: https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#agencytxt
      and https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#stopstxt).

      For this reason, this table contains multiple date and time labels associated with a given trip.
      Please consult each individual column's definition for guidance on which field is
      most appropriate for your use case.

          Regional Feed", and the MTC-published subfeeds have type "Regional Subfeed".
          If you are performing an analysis where using a regional combined feed is
          inappropriate (even though that is the customer-facing data), this field can
          help you assess other alternative feeds for the same services and organizations.

          This date is defined with respect to `feed_timezone`.

          This field should be used to:
          * Identify the service date that the agency assigns to this trip
          * Join with other internal-to-GTFS data that is keyed by service date
