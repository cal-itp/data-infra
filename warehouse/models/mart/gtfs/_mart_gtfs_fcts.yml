  - &rt_iteration_num
    name: iteration_num
    description: |
      0-based ordered count of `trip_start_time` values for this `trip_id`
      on this `service_date`. Ex.: If a given `trip_id` appears with
      `trip_start_time` values of "12:05:10" and "14:40:00", the first will
      have `iteration_num` of 0 and the second will have `iteration_num`
      of 1.
      This helps normalize the following cases:
      - For frequency-based trips: `trip_start_time` in RT data may not
      align exactly with the start time of any individual iteration in the
      schedule data (especially if `frequencies.exact_times` = 1 in
      schedule), so this field normalizes
      - Across RT feeds: We have seen cases where, for example, the trip
      updates feed provides `trip_start_time` (even for non-frequency-based
      trips) but the vehicle positions feed does not (the field is null).
      We can calculate a `iteration_num` of 0 for both feeds to account for
      this difference, because it is likely a byproduct of technical
      implementation rather than a true indication that the two represent
      different trips.

    description: |
      Attempt to identify the `service_date` (corresponding to the related
      schedule feed) for trip activity referenced in a GTFS RT feed. It uses
      the following fallback logic:
      * If `trip_start_date` is populated, use that. This is assumed to be
      provided with respect to `schedule_feed_timezone`.
      * Otherwise, for trip updates and vehicle positions, if
      `trip_update_timestamp` or `vehicle_timestamp` (respectively) are
      populated, convert that to the `schedule_feed_timezone` and extract the
      date from that.
      * Otherwise, use `header_timestamp` converted to `schedule_feed_timezone`
      and extract the date.
      * Finally (and this generally should not happen, since `header_timestamp`
      should be populated), fall back to `_extract_ts` converted to
      `schedule_feed_timezone` and extract the date.

      Schedule definition of a "date" data type or `fct_scheduled_trips` for
      more dates that can be associated with trip activity.

      This date is used so that this table's service summaries correspond to the
      service levels that an agency might describe on a given (service) date,
      even if that does not correspond to the actual calendar date on which the
      given trip activity occurred.

      Each row is a daily summary of a service alert.
      See https://gtfs.org/realtime/reference/#message-alert for information
      about message structure. An alert here is a unique combination of:
        * Message content (header, description, cause, effect)
        * Informed entity (agencies, routes, stops, trips)
        * Active period (start/end date)
      So an individual alert message can yield multiple rows in this table if it
      includes multiple informed entities or active periods.

      Caveat on uniqueness: We have a very small number of duplicate `key`
      values, specifically they can occur on days where the URL or time zone for
      a given feed change because of how the keys are generated upstream.

          The number of distinct extracts in our pipeline in which this trip
          occurred.
          If the feed publisher updates data less frequently than every 20 seconds
          (our scrape frequency) then identical data can appear in multiple
          extracts, so this does not necessarily represent the number of unique

      - name: tu_num_distinct_updates

          The number of distinct producer-produced timestamps for messages

          If trip update or vehicle timestamps are available, use the count of
          distinct values of that timestamp. Otherwise use count of distinct
          header timestamps for messages containing this trip.
          This should generally reflect how many distinct data updates there were
          for this trip in our data, though note that the producer timestamps
          can increment without the actual data values changing.

          Values are listed in alphabetical order, not the chronological order

      A table showing all trips that were scheduled according to GTFS schedule
      data.
      If a `service_date`, `trip_key` pair is present in this table,
      it means that that `trip_key` was scheduled to occur on that `service_date`.
      Specifically, it means that the associated `service_id` was active and had
      service scheduled. Dates where a `service_id` was active but not scheduled
      (for example, weekend dates within a weekday service's effective dates)
      are not listed in this table.

      The GTFS standard allows for a trip's scheduled stop activity to occur
      more than 24 hours after the beginning of the associated `service_date`.
      See https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#field-types for the GTFS
      definitions of times and dates.

      Additionally, different feeds use different time zones
      (see: https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#agencytxt
      and https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#stopstxt).

      For this reason, this table contains multiple date and time labels
      associated with a given trip.
      Please consult each individual column's definition for guidance on which
      field is most appropriate for your use case.

      This table only contains service through the date (UTC) on which the table
      was most recently run.

          Because GTFS data was downloaded in the v1 pipeline before
          `gtfs dataset` records were being archived in the warehouse,
          it is possible for GTFS data to be associated with a GTFS dataset
          record that was not yet in effect at the time the data was downloaded.
          (So, you may see GTFS data from January 2022 associated with a GTFS
          dataset record that does not take effect until July 2022.)
          This is done for convenience to facilitate labeling of older data
          (the alternative would be failing to join and making it essentially
          impossible to label historical GTFS data with their associated transit
          database records).

          The difference between `max_vehicle_timestamp` and
          `min_vehicle_timestamp` in minutes, representing the duration of time
          for which this trip was present in the trip-specific messages produced
          by the agency.
          Note that the trip may not have been present in every message between
          the minimum and maximum timestamps, and therefore may not have been
          present continuously for the duration listed here.
