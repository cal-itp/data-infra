      Each row is a unique date / feed pair, where the feed is the feed version that was in effect at

          Because GTFS data was downloaded in the v1 pipeline before
          `gtfs dataset` records were being archived in the warehouse,
          it is possible for GTFS data to be associated with a GTFS dataset
          record that was not yet in effect at the time the data was downloaded.
          (So, you may see GTFS data from January 2022 associated with a GTFS dataset
          record that does not take effect until July 2022.)
          This is done for convenience to facilitate labeling of older data (the alternative
          would be failing to join and making it essentially impossible to label
          historical GTFS data with any associated transit database records).

      Specifically, it means that the associated `service_id` was active and had service
      scheduled. Dates where a `service_id` was active but not scheduled (for example,
      weekend dates within a weekday service's effective dates) are not listed in this table.

        Because GTFS data was downloaded in the v1 pipeline before
        `gtfs dataset` records were being archived in the warehouse,
        it is possible for GTFS data to be associated with a GTFS dataset
        record that was not yet in effect at the time the data was downloaded.
        (So, you may see GTFS data from January 2022 associated with a GTFS dataset
        record that does not take effect until July 2022.)
        This is done for convenience to facilitate labeling of older data (the alternative
        would be failing to join and making it essentially impossible to label
        historical GTFS data with their associated transit database records).
