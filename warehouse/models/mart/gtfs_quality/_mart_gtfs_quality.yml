      of the month being reported on (so, attributes as of January 31 will drive whether
      organization is included for January report with publish date of February 1).
      Organizations are included if they are considered "reports site-assessed":
      * Organization has a reporting type of "Core" or "Other public transit"
      * Organization manages at least one currently-operating fixed-route service
      * That service has at least one customer-facing GTFS schedule feed; note that for MTC 511 agencies, the subfeed (instead of the combined regional feed)
