    description: |
      A daily model of validation notices found per feed. Data
      is filled in so there is always a count of notices per day
      per feed, even if that count is zero; null counts indicate
      a lack of validation for that feed on that day.
    columns:
      - name: key
        description: |
          Synthetic primary key constructed from date, feed_key, and code.

    description: |
      Contains the actually implemented checks, i.e. checks that
      show up in the underlying daily checks model. Tested against
      the "intended checks" to verify checks are actually implemented.
