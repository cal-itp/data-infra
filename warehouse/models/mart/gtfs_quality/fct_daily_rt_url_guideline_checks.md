{% docs fct_daily_rt_url_guideline_checks %}

Each row represents a date/guideline check/RT url combination, with pass/fail
information indicating whether that RT url complied with that check on that date.
A row will exist for every check, for every row from the index which is driven
by int_gtfs_rt__daily_url_index. Only contains checks that are performed at the RT url
level.

Here is a list of currently-implemented checks:

| Check | Feature | Description |
| ------------------------------------ |---------|------------ |
|Vehicle positions RT feed is present | Compliance (RT) | The vehicle positions RT feed contains at least one file on the given day.|
| Trip updates RT feed is present | Compliance (RT) | The trip updates RT feed contains at least one file on the given day.|
| Service alerts RT feed is present | Compliance (RT) | The service alerts RT feed contains at least one file on the given day.|
