{% docs fct_daily_guideline_checks %}

Each row represents a date/organization/service/feed/guideline/check combination, with pass/fail
information indicating whether that feed complied with that check on that date.

Here is a list of currently-implemented checks:

| Check | Feature | Description |
| ------------------------------------ |---------|------------ |
| No errors in MobilityData GTFS Schedule Validator | Compliance (Schedule) |GTFS Schedule Validator produced no errors for the transit providerâ€™s static feed. |
|No shapes-related errors appear in the MobilityData GTFS Validator | Accurate Service Data | None of the following shapes-related errors appear in the GTFS Schedule Validator: decreasing_shape_distance, equal_shape_distance_diff_coordinates, decreasing_or_equal_shape_distance, decreasing_or_equal_shape_distance |
| Feed will be valid for more than 7 days | Best Practices Alignment (Schedule) | The dataset expiration date defined in feed_info.txt is in 8 days or more |
| Feed will be valid for more than 30 days | Best Practices Alignment (Schedule) | The dataset expiration date defined in feed_info.txt is in 31 days or more |
|Shapes.txt file is present | Accurate Service Data | Static GTFS feed contains the file shapes.txt.|
| Every trip in trips.txt has a shape_id listed | Accurate Service Data | Every trip in trips.txt has a shape_id listed.|
|Technical contact is listed in feed_contact_email field within the feed_info.txt file | Technical Contact Availability | The feed_contact_email field in feed_info.txt contains a non-empty value.|
| Include tts_stop_name entries in stops.txt for stop names that are pronounced incorrectly in most mobile applications. | Accurate Accessibility Data | For every stop_name in stops.txt containing text that is commonly mispronounced in trip planning applications, there is a non-null tts_stop_name field which is not identical to the stop_name field. The commonly mispronounced text includes directional abbreviations ("n","s","e","w","ne","se","sw","nw","nb","sb","eb","wb"), right-of-way names ("st","rd","blvd","hwy"), two or more adjacent numerals, and the symbols "/", "(" and ")".|
|Includes complete wheelchair accessibility data in both stops.txt and trips.txt | Accurate Accessibility Data | Trips.txt contains non-empty values for each trip in the wheelchair_accessible column, and stops.txt contains non-empty values for each stop in the wheelchair_boarding column.|
| No pathways-related errors appear in the MobilityData GTFS Validator | Accurate Accessibility Data| A transit provider is eligible for this check if they have at least one stop listed in stops.txt that: 1) Has "station" or "transit center" in the name, 2) Serves rail, or 3) Has a parent_station listed. For transit providers eligible for this check, they will pass if none of the following pathways-related notices appear in the GTFS Schedule Validator: pathway_to_platform_with_boarding_areas, pathway_to_wrong_location_type, pathway_unreachable_location, missing_level_id, station_with_parent_station, wrong_parent_location_type. |
|Passes Fares v2 portion of MobilityData GTFS Schedule Validator | Fare Completeness | For feeds containing at least one of the files: fare_leg_rules, rider_categories, fare_containers, fare_products, fare_transfer_rules, none of the following errors appear in the MobilityData GTFS Schedule Validator: fare_transfer_rule_duration_limit_type_without_duration_limit, fare_transfer_rule_duration_limit_without_type, fare_transfer_rule_invalid_transfer_count, fare_transfer_rule_missing_transfer_count, fare_transfer_rule_with_forbidden_transfer_count, invalid_currency_amount. |
| No expired services are listed in the feed | Best Practices Alignment (Schedule) | Looking at both calendars.txt and calendar_dates.txt, no service_id's exist where the last in-effect date is in the past. |
| All schedule changes in the last month have provided at least 7 days of lead time | Up-to-Dateness | All changes made in the last 30 days to stops.txt, stop_times.txt, calendar.txt, and calendar_dates.txt did not impact trips within seven days of when the update was made. |
|Schedule feed downloads successfully | Compliance (Schedule) | On the given date, the schedule feed was downloaded and parsed successfully |
|No critical errors in the MobilityData GTFS Realtime Validator | Compliance (RT) | The feed has at least one GTFS-RT file present on the given day, and GTFS Realtime Validator produced no critical errors for any RT feed extract on that day.|
|All trip_ids provided in the GTFS-rt feed exist in the GTFS Schedule feed| Fixed-Route Completeness | Error code E003 does not appear in the MobilityData GTFS Realtime Validator on that day.|
|Vehicle positions RT feed is present | Compliance (RT) | The vehicle positions RT feed contains at least one file on the given day.|
| Trip updates RT feed is present | Compliance (RT) | The trip updates RT feed contains at least one file on the given day.|
| Service alerts RT feed is present | Compliance (RT) | The service alerts RT feed contains at least one file on the given day.|
| Service alerts RT feed uses HTTPS | Best Practice Alignment (RT) | The service alerts RT feed endpoint uses HTTPS instead of HTTPS to ensure feed integrity.|
|Vehicle positions RT feed uses HTTPS | Best Practice Alignment (RT) | The vehicle positions RT feed endpoint uses HTTPS instead of HTTPS to ensure feed integrity.|
| Trip updates RT feed uses HTTPS | Best Practice Alignment (RT) | The trip updates RT feed endpoint uses HTTPS instead of HTTPS to ensure feed integrity.|
| Fewer than 1% of requests to Trip updates RT feed result in a protobuf error | Best Practice Alignment (RT) | On the given day, fewer than 1% of Trip updates RT feed downloads result in a protobuf error.|
| Fewer than 1% of requests to Service alerts RT feed result in a protobuf error | Best Practice Alignment (RT) | On the given day, fewer than 1% of Service alerts RT feed downloads result in a protobuf error.|
| Fewer than 1% of requests to Vehicle positions RT feed result in a protobuf error | Best Practice Alignment (RT) | On the given day, fewer than 1% of Vehicle positions RT feed downloads result in a protobuf error.|
