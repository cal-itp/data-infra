      Versioned extracts of the NTD Annual Database Agency Information.

      The versioning is bitemporal, so records are versioned at the year

      and ntd_id level. This means you must join based on
      _valid_from/_valid_from

      to get the records for a given ntd_id, and then choose which year to

      look up.

      This dataset details federal, state, and local funding sources for each applicable agency reporting to the NTD.
      Federal funding sources are financial assistance obtained from the Federal Government to assist with the costs of providing transit services.
      NTD Data Tables organize and summarize data from the National Transit Database in a manner that is more useful for quick reference and summary analysis.
      This dataset is based on the Revenue Sources database file.

    description: >-
      Extracts of the NTD Complete Monthly Ridership with Adjustments and Estimates (UPT, VOMS, VRH, and VRM)
      that contains all monthly module data reported to the NTD since January 2002.
      Mode and Type of Service Changes and Impacts on this Time Series

      Monthly data are reported by mode and type of service.
      From 2002 through 2011, there were 16 modes in the NTD.
      NTD monthly ridership data is now reported according to refined modal classifications.
      Service previously reported as bus (MB) now may be reported as either MB, Commuter Bus (CB),
      or Bus Rapid Transit (RB).
      Additionally, service previously categorized as Light Rail (LR) now may be reported as LR or
      Streetcar (SR).

      Similarly, Types of Service were refined in Report Year 2019.
      From 2002 - 2018, there were two types of service:
        Directly Operated (DO) and
        Purchased Transportation (PT).

      As of 2019, Purchased Transportation is now classified such that agencies report the
      purchased transportation based on the type of contractor:
        general third party (PT),
        taxicab operator (TX),
        or transportation network company (TN).

      FTA concurrently removed the "Demand Response Taxi" (DT/PT) mode in 2019.
      FTA now considers all such service as Demand Response (DR) with Taxi (TX) type of service and
      this time series has been updated to reflect this change.

      This time series also considers modes which have been combined, collapsing the
      Automated Guideway (AG) and Monorail (MO) mode historical data into the
      Monorail/Automated Guideway (MG) mode to reflect the current reporting arrangement and
      allow for easier analysis of these modes.

      Finally, FTA introduced the Hybrid Rail (YR) mode in January 2012. While this mode combines
      some systems previously classified as either Commuter Rail (CR) or Light Rail (LR),
      this change could not be done uniformly; most operators of Hybrid Rail continued to
      offer services presently defined as CR or LR.
      Therefore, this time series does not attempt to combine historically.
      Data users should therefore take caution that the following systems converted completely
      from Commuter Rail to Hybrid Rail around this time:
      - 60048 Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Commuter Rail to Hybrid Rail)
      - 60101 Denton County Transportation Authority (Commuter Rail to Hybrid Rail)
      - 90030 North County Transit District (Light Rail to Hybrid Rail)
