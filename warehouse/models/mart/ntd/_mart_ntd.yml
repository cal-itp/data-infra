      Contains basic contact and agency information for each NTD reporter.

      The dataset can be found at:
        https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2023-annual-database-agency-information
        * For other years, just replace 2023 by the desired year.

      The versioning is bitemporal, so records are versioned at the year, ntd_id, and state_parent_ntd_id level.
      This means you must join based on _valid_from/_valid_from to get the records for a given ntd_id and state_parent_ntd_id,
      and then choose which year to look up.

      Use _is_current to find the latest version for each set of year, ntd_id, and state_parent_ntd_id.

          Agencies that do not receive or benefit from FTA funding may elect to submit their data to the NTD as Voluntary Reporter but are still assigned a reporter type.
          Current types are:

      Provides transit agency-wide totals for service data for applicable agencies reporting to the National Transit Database.
      This view displays the data at a higher level (by agency), based on the "NTD Annual Data - Service (by Mode and Time Period)" dataset.
      In the years 2015-2021, you can find this data in the "Service" data table on NTD Program website, at https://transit.dot.gov/ntd/ntd-data.
      In versions of the data tables from before 2014, you can find data on service in the file called "Transit Operating Statistics: Service Supplied and Consumed."

  - name: dim_monthly_ridership_with_adjustments
    description: >-
      Extracts of the NTD Complete Monthly Ridership with Adjustments and Estimates (UPT, VOMS, VRH, and VRM)
      that contains all monthly module data reported to the NTD since January 2002.
      Mode and Type of Service Changes and Impacts on this Time Series

      Monthly data are reported by mode and type of service.
      From 2002 through 2011, there were 16 modes in the NTD.
      NTD monthly ridership data is now reported according to refined modal classifications.
      Service previously reported as bus (MB) now may be reported as either MB, Commuter Bus (CB),
      or Bus Rapid Transit (RB).
      Additionally, service previously categorized as Light Rail (LR) now may be reported as LR or
      Streetcar (SR).

      Similarly, Types of Service were refined in Report Year 2019.
      From 2002 - 2018, there were two types of service:
        Directly Operated (DO) and
        Purchased Transportation (PT).

      As of 2019, Purchased Transportation is now classified such that agencies report the
      purchased transportation based on the type of contractor:
        general third party (PT),
        taxicab operator (TX),
        or transportation network company (TN).

      FTA concurrently removed the "Demand Response Taxi" (DT/PT) mode in 2019.
      FTA now considers all such service as Demand Response (DR) with Taxi (TX) type of service and
      this time series has been updated to reflect this change.

      This time series also considers modes which have been combined, collapsing the
      Automated Guideway (AG) and Monorail (MO) mode historical data into the
      Monorail/Automated Guideway (MG) mode to reflect the current reporting arrangement and
      allow for easier analysis of these modes.

      Finally, FTA introduced the Hybrid Rail (YR) mode in January 2012. While this mode combines
      some systems previously classified as either Commuter Rail (CR) or Light Rail (LR),
      this change could not be done uniformly; most operators of Hybrid Rail continued to
      offer services presently defined as CR or LR.
      Therefore, this time series does not attempt to combine historically.
      Data users should therefore take caution that the following systems converted completely
      from Commuter Rail to Hybrid Rail around this time:
      - 60048 Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Commuter Rail to Hybrid Rail)
      - 60101 Denton County Transportation Authority (Commuter Rail to Hybrid Rail)
      - 90030 North County Transit District (Light Rail to Hybrid Rail)
