      Versioned extracts of the NTD Annual Database Agency Information.

      For example, the 2021 dataset is found at
      https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2021-annual-database-agency-information.

      Only contains 2021 data as of 2022-02-08 but we will be importing

      more data in the future.

      The versioning is bitemporal, so records are versioned at the year

      and ntd_id level. This means you must join based on
      _valid_from/_valid_from

      to get the records for a given ntd_id, and then choose which year to

      look up.

      This dataset details federal, state, and local funding sources for each applicable agency reporting to the NTD in Report Year 2022.
      Federal funding sources are financial assistance obtained from the Federal Government to assist with the costs of providing transit services.
      NTD Data Tables organize and summarize data from the 2022 National Transit Database in a manner that is more useful for quick reference and summary analysis.
      This dataset is based on the 2022 Revenue Sources database file.
