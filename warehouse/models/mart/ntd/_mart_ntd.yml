      Versioned extracts of the NTD Annual Database Agency Information.

      For example, the 2021 dataset is found at
      https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2021-annual-database-agency-information.

      Only contains 2021 data as of 2022-02-08 but we will be importing

      more data in the future.

      The versioning is bitemporal, so records are versioned at the year

      and ntd_id level. This means you must join based on
      _valid_from/_valid_from

      to get the records for a given ntd_id, and then choose which year to

      look up.
