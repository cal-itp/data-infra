      - be *produced* by one or more `organizations`
      - be *published* by an `organizations`.

  - name: dim_gtfs_service_data
    description: |
      Each record links together a single `gtfs dataset` and one (if possible)
      or more `services`.  Additional fields define how to isolate the service
      within the `gtfs dataset` (see below).
      Many services have more than one GTFS dataset which describes their service. Often these
      are either precursors to *final* datasets (e.g. AC Transit's GTFS dataset is a
      precursor to the Bay Area 511 dataset) or artifacts produced in other processes such as
      creating GTFS Realtime

      To identify specific records within a given dataset that
      correspond to the listed service:
      * Selection levels are in following order: agency_id, network_id, route_id
      * BLANK indicates ALL records
      * Comma-separated list for values that should be selected at that selection level
      * "*" indicates remaining records after other selections at that selection level

        description: |
          If only a selection of `agency.agency_id` within the GTFS Dataset
          should be selected to represent a specific `services` record, they are
          listed here.  If all `agency_id` should be selected, this is blank.

    description: |
      Each record links together an organization with a GTFS dataset,
      where the organization manages a service for which that GTFS dataset is "primary".
      Thus, each row represents a unique "primary" organization / service / gtfs_service_data /
      gtfs_dataset relationship. This table can be used to determine what
      GTFS dataset(s) represent a given provider's service(s); i.e., if
      trying to determine whether a given "agency" "has" GTFS, this table can
      be used to make that determination.

      Note that GTFS datasets whose service relationships are null or unknown
      will not be present here.
