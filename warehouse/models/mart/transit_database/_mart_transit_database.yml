          For example for MTC 511, the combined regional feed has type "Combined
          Regional Feed", and the MTC-published subfeeds have type "Regional Subfeed".
          If you are performing an analysis where using a regional combined feed is

          help you assess other alternative feeds for the same services and organizations.

        description: |

          this field contains the first value of that field that appeared for this source_record_id.
          For record versions that had regional_feed_type populated in the source database, this field
          contains the value current for that version.

          So, for example, if the regional_feed_type field was first populated for source_record_id A
          on September 1 with value "Regional Subfeed", this field will contain that "Regional Subfeed"
          value for the source_record_id A record that was active on August 31, even though the raw
          regional_feed_type field was not populated for that record version.

      Each record links together an organization with a service and a set of up to four
      GTFS datasets (schedule, RT service alerts, RT vehicle positions, and RT trip updates),
      where the organization manages the service.
      This table can be used to determine what GTFS dataset(s) represent a given provider's service(s);
      i.e., this table can be used to determine whether a given "agency" "has" GTFS.

      Because this table is versioned and represents many-to-many relationships (for example, one organization manages
      multiple services or a given service is represented in multiple sets of GTFS datasets),
      joins using this table can result in fanout, even when joining with reference to a specific date.

      For best results, join with reference to a specific date, and make sure to choose a specific
      output grain (organizations, services, customer-facing vs. not); you will likely need to filter
      or group to get the desired output.

          The types are:
          * "Combined Regional Feed" - These GTFS datasets contain information
            about services managed by a variety of different organizations. If the
            customer-facing feed for an organization or service is this category,
            users may need to filter within feed data when doing more granular (ex.
            agency-level) analysis.
          * "Regional Subfeed" - Currently this category only applies to MTC 511, which provides
            an option to query the combined regional feed for a given agency's data.
          * "Regional Precursor Feed" - This category applies to agencies whose data appears in a
            combined regional feed but who produce some other independent dataset.
            The independent dataset may be an input into the combined regional feed.

          Rather than using a synthetic _is_current, _valid_from, and _valid_to, we rely on The
          `issue_creation_time` and `resolution_date` fields present in the source data to time-bound
          data validity. This field records the active GTFS dataset key mapped to the issue at the
          time it was created.
