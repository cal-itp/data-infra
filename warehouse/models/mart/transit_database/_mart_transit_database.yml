      Each record links together a single `gtfs dataset` and one (if possible)
      or more `services`.  Additional fields define how to isolate the service
      within the `gtfs dataset` (see below).
      Many services have more than one GTFS dataset which describes their service. Often these
      are either precursors to *final* datasets (e.g. AC Transit's GTFS dataset is a
      precursor to the Bay Area 511 dataset) or artifacts produced in other processes such as
      creating GTFS Realtime

      To identify specific records within a given dataset that
      correspond to the listed service:
      * Selection levels are in following order: agency_id, network_id, route_id
      * BLANK indicates ALL records
      * Comma-separated list for values that should be selected at that selection level
      * "*" indicates remaining records after other selections at that selection level
