    description: |
      Each record links together a single `gtfs dataset` and one (if possible)
      or more `services`.  Additional fields define how to isolate the service
      within the `gtfs dataset` (see below).
      Many services have more than one GTFS dataset which describes their service. Often these
      are either precursors to *final* datasets (e.g. AC Transit's GTFS dataset is a
      precursor to the Bay Area 511 dataset) or artifacts produced in other processes such as
      creating GTFS Realtime

      To identify specific records within a given dataset that
      correspond to the listed service:
      * Selection levels are in following order: agency_id, network_id, route_id
      * BLANK indicates ALL records
      * Comma-separated list for values that should be selected at that selection level
      * "*" indicates remaining records after other selections at that selection level

      This table can be used to determine what GTFS dataset(s) represent a given provider's service(s);
      i.e., this table can be used to determine whether a given "agency" "has" GTFS.

          The types are:
          * "Combined Regional Feed" - These GTFS datasets contain information
            about services managed by a variety of different organizations. If the
            customer-facing feed for an organization or service is this category,
            users may need to filter within feed data when doing more granular (ex.
            agency-level) analysis.
          * "Regional Subfeed" - Currently this category only applies to MTC 511, which provides
            an option to query the combined regional feed for a given agency's data.
          * "Regional Precursor Feed" - This category applies to agencies whose data appears in a
            combined regional feed but who produce some other independent dataset.
            The independent dataset may be an input into the combined regional feed.
