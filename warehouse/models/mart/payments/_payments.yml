  - name: fct_payments_aggregations
    description: |
      Each row in this table is an "aggregation".
      An "aggregation" is a group of micropayment/transactions processed (authorised and settled) together.
      This table summarizes information about aggregations which can be used to reconcile
      payments information with other sources.
      Note: This table does not currently include information from the refunds source data, but it does contain refund information
      present in the micropayments and settlements source data.
    columns:
      - *participant_id
      - &organization_name
        name: organization_name
        description: |
          Name of the Cal-ITP defined organization (from `dim_organizations`) associated with this payments activity.
          The mapping of organization records to payments entities is manually maintained in a seed file.
      - &organization_source_record_id
        name: organization_source_record_id
        description: |
          `source_record_id` of the Cal-ITP defined organization (from `dim_organizations`) associated with this payments activity.
          The mapping of organization records to payments entities is manually maintained in a seed file.
      - name: aggregation_id
        description: |
          Aggregation ID that uniquely identifies this aggregation.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique
      - name: aggregation_datetime
        description: |
          Datetime of settlement if present, otherwise falls back to authorisation, otherwise falls back to micropayment.
          This can be used to represent the most recent update for the aggregation.
      - name: has_micropayment
        description: |
          If "true", there is at least one micropayment in the micropayments source data with this aggregation ID.
          Essentially all aggregations should have a micropayment because the micropayment is the first step
          in the payment workflow.
      - name: has_authorisation
        description: |
          If "true", there is at least one authorisation in the authorisations source data with this aggregation ID.
          Authorisation is the second step in the payment workflow after the micropayment occurs.
      - name: has_settlement
        description: |
          If "true", there is at least one settlement in the settlements source data with this aggregation ID.
          Settlement is the final step in the payment workflow, so some aggregations may be missing
          settlements simply because they are not processed yet.
      - name: authorisation_retrieval_reference_number
        description: |
          Retrieval reference number for the most recent authorisation of this aggregation.
      - name: settlement_retrieval_reference_number

          This field can be used to map to Elavon data.

          Transaction amount of the most recent authorisation associated with this aggregation.
          Note that `CARD_CHECK` authorisations may have transaction amount of 0 even if the transaction being authorised will
          ultimately have a larger transaction amount.
