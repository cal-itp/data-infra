  - name: fct_payments_aggregations
    description: |
      Each row in this table is an "aggregation".
      An "aggregation" is a group of micropayment/transactions processed (authorised and settled) together.
      This table summarizes information about aggregations which can be used to reconcile
      payments information with other sources.
      Note: This table does not currently include information from the refunds source data, but it does contain refund information
      present in the micropayments and settlements source data.
    columns:
      - *participant_id
      - &organization_name
        name: organization_name
        description: |
          Name of the Cal-ITP defined organization (from `dim_organizations`) associated with this payments activity.
          The mapping of organization records to payments entities is manually maintained in a seed file.

        description: |
          The last day of the month of the aggregation_datetime in Pacific Time (involves conversion of aggregation_datetime to Pacific Time).
          This column is primarily for use in BI tooling to support consistent dates across activity types.
          Aggregation activity happens throughout the month.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: end_of_month_date_utc
        description: |
          The last day of the month of the aggregation_datetime in UTC.
          This column preserves the end of month date value for the original UTC date as received by Littlepay, however,
          `end_of_month_date_pacific` is primarily used in BI tooling instead to support consistent dates across activity types.
          Aggregation activity happens throughout the month.

      - name: has_micropayment
        description: |
          If "true", there is at least one micropayment in the micropayments source data with this aggregation ID.
          Essentially all aggregations should have a micropayment because the micropayment is the first step
          in the payment workflow.
      - name: has_authorisation
        description: |
          If "true", there is at least one authorisation in the authorisations source data with this aggregation ID.
          Authorisation is the second step in the payment workflow after the micropayment occurs.
      - name: has_settlement
        description: |
          If "true", there is at least one settlement in the settlements source data with this aggregation ID.
          Settlement is the final step in the payment workflow, so some aggregations may be missing
          settlements simply because they are not processed yet.
