      This table is a cut of the cleaned metadata representing GTFS datasets currently
      active within the Cal-ITP ecosystem. Each record represents a GTFS dataset (feed)
      that is either a type of GTFS Schedule, Trip Updates, Vehicle Locations or Alerts,
      and provides base64-encoded URLs used to access that feed.

    columns:
      - name: name
        description: |
          An arbitrary human-readable title for the GTFS feed in question, usually
          referencing the corresponding agency transit agency and feed type.
      - name: type
        description: |
          GTFS data type ("schedule", "trip_updates",
          "vehicle_positions", or "service_alerts")
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ["trip_updates", "vehicle_positions", "service_alerts"]

      - name: regional_feed_type
        description: |
          Describes whether this feed is a combined regional feed or has a relation
          to a combined regional feed in some manner.
          For example for MTC 511, the combined regional feed has type "Combined
          Regional Feed", and the MTC-published subfeeds have type "Regional Subfeed".
          If you are performing an analysis where using a regional combined feed is
          inappropriate (even though that is the customer-facing data), this field can
          help you assess other alternative feeds for the same services and organizations.
          Not specified (null) for feeds with no relationship to regional feeds.
      - name: base64url_url
        description: |
          Base64URL-encoded URL of the GTFS feed referenced by the row, using
          URL-safe base64 as described in
          https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#to_base64
      - name: string_url
        description: |
          Plaintext URL of the GTFS feed referenced by the row, unencoded for
          convenience directly from the value of base64url_url.
      - name: schedule_to_use_for_rt_validation_base64url_url
        description: |
          Base64-encoded URL of the GTFS schedule feed associated with the row, only
          filled with a value for rows representing non-schedule-type feeds
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: [NULL]
              config:

      - name: schedule_to_use_for_rt_validation_string_url
        description: |
          Plaintext URL of the GTFS schedule feed associated with the row, only
          filled with a value for rows representing non-schedule-type feeds,
          unencoded for convenience directly from the value of
