    description: "### Visualization: Table\n\nShows latest feeds that are missing\
      \ any of: calendar, calendar_dates, routes, shapes, stops, stop_times, trips.\n\
      \nExplanatory note: The first join on is_loadable_file creates a \"cross join\"\
      \ between dim_files (the list of GTFS files like routes, trips, etc.) and fact_daily_feed_files\
      \ (the list of files for each feed version), so that you get a table that has\
      \ every combination of feed_key (versioned GTFS feed) and GTFS file, even if\
      \ the given feed does not actually contain the given GTFS file. \n\nBy identifying\
      \ each possible feed/file combination, we can then check for which ones are\
      \ missing, which is accomplished in the rest of the question logic.\n\n####\
