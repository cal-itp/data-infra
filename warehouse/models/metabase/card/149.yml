    description: "### Visualization: Scatter\n\nFor a given hash of a row (which indicates\
      \ unique records), this query checks how long ago that row of data was created,\
      \ and how many files littlepay has exported with that row of data in it.\n\n\
      There is a clear association between number of days since creation and number\
      \ of files the row is exported to. It is not 1-to-1, and it appears likely that\
      \ littlepay has been inconsistent with when it has exported snapshots.\n\n####\
      \ Query\n\n```\nSELECT\n    calitp_hash,\n    MIN(DATE_TRUNC(created_date, DAY))\
      \ AS created_date_min,\n    MAX(DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), DATE(created_date),\
      \ DAY)) AS n_days_since_creation_max,\n    COUNT(*) AS n_records\nFROM `cal-itp-data-infra.payments.stg_enriched_product_data`\n\
