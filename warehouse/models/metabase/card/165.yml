    description: '### Visualization: Table


      Though micropayments should be able to link to multiple device transactions
      (e.g., in the case of tap on/off), a device transaction should never be linked
      to multiple micropayments. This table should be empty if all micropayment device
      transactions are valid.


      #### Query


      ```

      select *

      from `payments.invalid_cleaned_micropayment_device_transactions`

      ```
