    label: Current trips with no pickups or drop offs
    description: '### Visualization: Table


      Question showing current GTFS datasets whose feeds contain trips where all stops
      on the trip have pickup_type = drop_off_type = 1 indicating that it is not possible
      to board or alight the trip at any stops.


      Note that not all such trips may necessarily be actually associated with active
      services, so they may not be "scheduled".
