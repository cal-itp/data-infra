    description: |
      *Deprecated May 2023 in favor of the `organizations.raw_ntd_id` column entered directly in Airtable.*

      Extract of Airtable mapping from NTD agency info to
      transit database organizations. Originally extracted
      from stg_transit_database__ntd_agency_info with the following query.

      select ntd_id, legacy_ntd_id, org.id as organization_record_id, org.name as organization_name
      from staging.stg_transit_database__ntd_agency_info ntd
      left join staging.stg_transit_database__organizations org
      on ntd.organization_key = org.id
      and ntd.dt = org.dt
      where ntd.dt = (select max(dt) from staging.stg_transit_database__ntd_agency_info)
      ;

      There are also a few records in here that were manually added after looking at the 2021 NTD
      data and comparing that to see if any records were missing.
